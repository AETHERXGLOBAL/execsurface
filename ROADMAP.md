# Roadmap

## M0 — Architecture Freeze

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

## M1 — Minimal Linux Observer

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Metadata-only native ptrace backend on Linux x86_64. CI proves descendant exec observation, argv non-capture sentinel, path-based file observation, loopback connect destination, strict Clippy, and locked dependency reproducibility.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M1_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M2 — Canonicalization

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Deterministic canonical surface across PID/sequence/interleaving and declared machine-root variance. Explicit semantic roots, credential-shadow protection, unresolved-path semantics, deterministic deduplication, open-intent preservation, and observer→canonical repeatability are covered by CI.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M2_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M3 — Baseline Lock

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

`execsurface learn -- COMMAND` creates a deterministic `execsurface.lock.json` with a frozen SHA-256 digest contract, privacy-safe command identity, explicit schema/versioning, atomic publication and no silent overwrite.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M3_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M4 — Diff Engine

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Verified baseline ingestion, comparability gating, deterministic added/removed findings, conservative changed pairing, JSON/text reporting, and real `learn → check` integration are covered by CI.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M4_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M5 — Policy / Verdict

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Independent policy v1 maps M4 findings to ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK using deterministic order-independent rule resolution. No drift is always PASS; operational/comparability failures remain ERROR.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M5_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M6 — GitHub Action

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Linux x86_64 composite Action with deterministic JSON evidence, Markdown job summary, artifact upload, PASS/REVIEW/BLOCK/ERROR enforcement, configurable REVIEW failure and privacy smoke evidence.

SARIF finding emission is **KILLED / DEFERRED for M6 v1** because current runtime evidence does not establish a causal repository source file/line. ExecSurface does not invent source locations for Code Scanning.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M6_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M7 — External Real-World Proof

**NOT STARTED**

Compatibility proof against an external open-source project before requesting maintainer integration.
